The linting feedback you received is about the spacing and trailing whitespace in your Python code. Here's how you can address it:

Expected 2 blank lines: This means there should be two blank lines before the function definition. You can simply add an additional blank line before the def line(): line.

Trailing whitespace: This means there are extra spaces at the end of some lines. Remove these extra spaces.

After addressing these issues, your code should look something like this:

python
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Task 0
"""

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def line():
    """
    """
    y = np.arange(0, 11) ** 3
    plt.plot(y, color='red')
    plt.xlim(0, 10)
    plt.show()
